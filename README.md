Introduction
-------------
This is a simple raytracer made in C++, outputting a reasonably good image.
It was originally me messing around with PPM files, which then turned into a raycaster and eventually a raytracer.

Features:
---------
- Lambertian shading
- Material for metal with 'fuzz'
- Simple camera system
- Support for multiple spheres
- Linear RGB
- Linear space -> Gamma space (gamma correction)
- Reflection
- Refraction
- PPM output

Upcoming Features:
------------------
- Quadrilaterals
- Move from RGB to spectral
- BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchies)
- Textures
- Lights
- Multiple scenes
- Instancing
- Volumes
- More standardized file format (PNG, JPEG, etc...)
